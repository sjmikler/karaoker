# karaoker

Mass download karaoke songs from https://usdb.animux.de/.

### Instructions

Prerequisites:
* Python >= 3.6
* [UltraStar Deluxe](https://github.com/UltraStar-Deluxe/USDX) or other compatible karaoke game

1. Login to animux and note down your `PHPSESSID` cookie (using developer settings, section `storage`)
2. Set up correct paths and variables in `constants.yaml` (alternatively set corresponding environment variables)
3. Optionally create **song list**, see below
4. Install all the requirements from `requirements.txt` in your python environment
5. Run `main.py`

> If you try to download age restricted youtube video, the download will fail.
> To proceed, set INTERACTIVE_AUTHENTICATION=true, then you will be prompted to login (via [pytube](https://github.com/pytube/pytube)).

Whatever you set as `FINAL_DIRECTORY` is ready to be used by UltraStar Deluxe.

Your existing songs will not be affected. Files existing in `FINAL_DIRECTORY` will not be overriden.
For example, if you modify song offset in an already downloaded `.txt` file, it will not be overriden by karaoker.

### Explanation: song list

This is a list of all the songs you want to download.

Each line in this file is a download query in form:

```
ARTIST;TITLE;MAX_SONGS_TO_DOWNLOAD;LANGUAGE
```

You can leave some of the fields blank.
If more than 1 song matches your query, they will be sorted in the order of popularity on animux and downloaded.
For example:

* You can use query `ABBA;;10` to download 10 most popular `ABBA` songs
* You can specify the title like `AC/DC;Back in Black`, then the number of songs to download defaults to 1
* You can use `;;10;english` to download 10 most popular english songs

**Example song list content**

```
# My favourite songs
Skillet;;5
Skillet;Feel Invincible
Andrzej Zaucha;Gumisie

# Hits that everyone knows
;;20;english
;;20;polish

# Songs for my dad
