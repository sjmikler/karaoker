### Explanation: song list

This is a list of all the songs you want to download.

Each line in this file is a download query in form:

```
ARTIST;TITLE;MAX_SONGS_TO_DOWNLOAD;LANGUAGE
```

You can leave some of the fields blank.
If more than 1 song matches your query, they will be sorted in the order of popularity.
For example:

* You can use query `ABBA;;10` to download 10 most popular `ABBA` songs.
* You can specify the title `AC/DC;Back in Black`, then the number of songs defaults to 1.
* You can use `;;10;english` to download 10 most popular english songs.
